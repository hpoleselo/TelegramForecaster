# Waves Forecast on Telegram

Original project was being developed under my ``` tools ``` repository (https://github.com/hpoleselo/tools/tree/master/WavesForecast).
But since it could be used by others i thought it would be nicer to have a separate repo for it.

## Requirements

```pandas```, ```lxml```, ```BeautifulSoup```, ```python-telegram-bot``` and ```requests```. Just run this command to install them all:

``` $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```

## Usage
